## How to Use

1. Include the required CSS and Javascript files in your HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/card-expander.css">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
    <script src="js/card-expander.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Create the HTML structure for the card:

```html
<div class="card-expander">
    <div class="card-header">
        <!-- Card header content (visible all the time) -->
        <h3>Card Title</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="card-content">
        <!-- Additional card content (hidden by default) -->
        <p>Additional information goes here...</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

3. Customize the appearance of the card using the provided CSS classes (`card-expander`, `card-header`, `card-content`, etc.) or create your own styles.

4. Initialize the card expander by calling the `initCardExpander()` function in your Javascript file or inline script:

```html
<script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
        initCardExpander();
    });
</script>
```

5. Now your card expanders are ready to use! When users click on the card header, the additional content will expand and collapse smoothly.

## Customization

You can easily customize the appearance and behavior of the card expander by modifying the CSS and adjusting the provided classes. The CSS is well-organized and commented to help you understand each part of the card expander's design.
